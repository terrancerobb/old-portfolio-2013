      <h1>Who I Am</h1>
      <p>I have been working on some form of design for more than half of my life. I thoroughly enjoy projects that involve a creative mindset, and I&rsquo;m in love with creating music and making sound, as well as shooting &amp; directing video.</p>

        <h4>How it all began</h4>
        <p>My whole life, I've been into creating things. Before I had a medium, I was constantly lost in my own imagination&mdash;creating my own universes and superpowers, heroes and nemeses, plights and rescues. My backyard was my mind's stage. I was also constantly taking my toys apart to figure out what made them work.</p>
        <p>The day my parents brought home our first computer in 1999, my life changed. I was immediately drawn to the technology, the idea of the internet and being able to talk to other people online. My curiosity and need to create things started emerging in the form of small projects and bursts of ideas. I used an AOL chatroom game made for Pok&eacute;mon roleplaying, and eventually I wanted to make my own. Ultimately, I just copied theirs and tinkered with the code in Visual Basic. I had absolutely zero idea what I was doing, but it felt amazing to be able to see behind the scenes in this way.</p>
        <p>A short time after this, I discovered Angelfire. I discovered that I could have my own website. Angelfire at the time had a sort of "beginner mode" with a simple interface for making websites with some text and up to 3 images.</p>

      <div class="left">
        <h4>Gotta post 'em all</h4>
        <p>Only 3 images? That's ridiculous! I have at least 20 pictures of Pok&eacute;mon to post (yes, Pok&eacute;mon is a recurring item in my personal history). Something needed to change, but how could I add more pictures to my website? After a stressful decision-making process, I switched my website to 'advanced mode,' from which there was no turning back.</p>
        <p>Suddenly there was no user interface with areas for body text and images. Gone was the ability to easily edit each of these things. All that was in front of me now was a text box full of HTML code. I was terrified, but I dug in. I did some research and found out what code was used to place images. Suddenly, I had many more than just 3 images on my website. It was glorious, and I would boast to my friends in my 5th grade class that "I had a website," and "all you have to do is go to this address." I couldn't have been more proud.</p>
        <p>Over the years, I eventually started playing with software called Micrografx Windows Draw, which was eventually purchased by <a href="http://www.corel.com/">Corel</a>. This introduced me to graphics and styling in ways that MSPaint couldn't offer. I spent a large portion of my time creating forum avatars, image manipulations and personal wallpapers.

        <h4>"Hey, listen to what I just learned"</h4>
        <p>Around this time, I was beginning to pick up a guitar and learning how to play and write songs. I became addicted to learning and perfecting riffs and solos, and loved playing with every musician I could find. I found myself in a friendly competition with <a href="http://jeremycrapsey.com/">Jeremy Crapsey</a> to learn to play new things first. This competetive time helped the both of us learn many things in a short period of time, and become in sync musically.</p>
        <p>Within a few years, it became evident that a drummer was a commodity, and hard to come by. My friends and I had so much trouble finding someone to play drums with us, that I eventually came to the conclusion that I should try my hand at playing them. After trying a small electric drum pad while jamming at a friend's house, I became hooked on that idea.</p>
        <p>I would listen to Metallica, Black Sabbath, AC/DC... anything with a drum beat that I wanted to learn. I sat in my room and studied which hands and which feet did what on a set of drums. I would air drum until I was able to confidently 'play' some songs. I was addicted to learning the drums. I bought my first drum set from a friend for $20. It was technically made for kids, but it was something I could actually hit with drumsticks so I didn't care.</p>

        <h4>Making noise</h4>
        <p>Since then, I've gone through several (real) sets of drums, and even more computers. I've played music with a variety people and ended up in garages, at high school talent shows, and even on a stage once or twice. I've spent many hours at home writing, composing, recording and mixing music. Even more of many of my days went into designing graphics and websites, and learning to code them (and the occasional game of Pok&eacute;mon).</p>
        <p>While watching some videos for a new company's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship_Studios">flagship</a> game that I highly anticipated, I stumbled on a <a href="http://youtu.be/59FLhG01fi8">video</a> involving sound effects. I had never known how much awesome technology and technique went into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foley_%28filmmaking%29">foley</a> work. To this day, I find foley to be an incredibly interesting art form, and for all I know it may one day end up a bigger part of my life.</p>

        <h4>Making noise</h4>
        <p>Years ago, I left a job at a tech support callcenter to join a local news startup, called <a href="http://toledointernetnews.com/">Toledo Internet News</a>. I joined with aspirations to work with a video camera and edit together footage. Little did I know, I would also get to know how stressful and rewarding it was to arrive on scene as news itself is taking place, and attempt to capture it.</p>
