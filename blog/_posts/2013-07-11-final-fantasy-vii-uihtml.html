<p>So, I decided to try to re-create the iconic Final Fantasy VII UI style using HTML and CSS. Of course, it doesn't look identical to the way you may remember it, unless you're looking at it using a very small screen. Because of the higher resolution. I feel like it transitions well into a high resolution, though.</p>
<p>I did my best to maintain the background and border colors of the actual, original UI, and I added a screenshot as a background to give an idea of what it would look like over a scene. I'm sure the quote and the scene don't quite match up, though.</p>
