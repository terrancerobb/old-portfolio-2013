<img class="post" src="/blog/img/new-website-1-point-0.jpg" alt="New Website, 1.0!">
<p>Welcome to my website. Here's what's new:</p>
<ul>
	<li>All-new design</li>
	<li>Brand new self-hosted blog</li>
	<li>Hosted on GitHub Pages, using Jekyll to generate all pages</li>
	<li>Works page with up-to-date projects</li>
	<li>...and more! Please feel free to explore!</li>
</ul>
<p>After a fair amount of work, the first release version of my website/personal portfolio/blog is ready for me to show you. A new website release and reveal is always exciting. It's been a few years since I designed the last iteration of this website, and it was getting stale.</p>
<p>I feel that this design is a culmination of my personal design preferences, as well as what I've observed regarding design up to this point. Please <a href="/contact/">let me know what you think</a>, and <a href="/works/">check out my works</a>!</p>
