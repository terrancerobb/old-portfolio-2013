<p>TerranceRobb.com is now a fully responsive website! Using media queries to make responsive breakpoints, I was able to make every page of this website respond to the size of the browser, all the way down to mobile.</p>
<p>Currently, the breakpoints are as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">
@media only screen and (min-width : 768px) and (max-width : 959px){
	/* Tablets and small screens */
}
</code></pre>
and
<pre><code class="language-css">
@media screen and (max-width: 767px) {
	/* Mobile and below */
}
</code></pre>
<p>Go ahead and give it a try! You can test the responsiveness of this website by resizing your browser window horizontally. Right now, the website will fit onto mobile phones and tablets, and I might add a larger version for screens 1200px wide and larger. This is my first responsive website design, and I had a blast working on it.</p>
<p>After having designed one, I can definitely see a few ways my thought process while designing will change, taking into account where things will go and how they will react on different screen sizes.</p>
