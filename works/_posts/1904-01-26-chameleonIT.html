<h4>Involved: Sketching, HTML, CSS, ASP.NET, Javascript, and jQuery</h4>
<p><a href="/works/graphics/chameleon.html">Chameleon Power</a> is a multi-faceted company that provides visualization software to many different industries (including homebuilders, roofers, painters, and <a href="http://www.chameleonpower.com/industry/">quite a few more</a>.) They also provide IT and hosting services.</p>
<h4>Description of Service Provided:</h4>
<p>Chameleon Power's IT services and technologies were being represented by an outdated site with out-of-date information and user experience. I quickly got to work helping them create a great looking website that will help drive sales and positive user interaction</p>

<p>I worked closely with department and team leaders as well as the company president on this website. Implementing content curated both from the old website, and new content generated by marketing staff, I created a web experience focused on this data and information.</p>
<p>I removed the frustration from the old user experience with a more concise, easy to understand navigation and flow.</p>
