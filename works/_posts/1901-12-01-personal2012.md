<p>RV Wholesale Superstore, or RVWSS, is a website used to sell new and used recreation vehicles (RVs, trailers, fifth wheels, popups and the like) and ship them nationally. It was a very involved project, involving building a WordPress theme from the ground up based on mockups made for each page. The idea behind RVWSS that differentiates it from its competitors is that, instead of being limited to inventory in stock, RVWSS also highlights units that can be ordered in for customers.</p>
<p>RV Wholesale Superstore has a heavy emphasis on guiding users to where they need to be to make a purchase without being too pushy. The site is meant to be the national, rather than local, face of <a href="http://aacoach.com/">All American Coach Co.</a> with a big selling point being nation-wide shipping.</p>
