<h4>Involved: Photoshop, HTML, CSS</h4>
<p>Although I created all of the image assets for <a href="http://rvwss.com/">RVWSS</a>, this was one that I particularly liked. This is a page header for a particular brand of RVs that RV Wholesale Superstore sells. I used assets straight from the RV manufacturer to give this image a professional look and feel.</p>
