<h4>Involved: Photoshop, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery</h4>
<p>Chameleon Power is a multi-faceted company that provides visualization software to many different industries (including homebuilders, roofers, painters, and <a href="http://www.chameleonpower.com/industry/">quite a few more</a>.) They also provide <a href="/works/graphics/chameleon-it.html">IT and hosting services</a>.</p>
<h4>Description of Service Provided:</h4>
<p>When I began working with Chameleon Power, updating their website was a priority. The face of the company had been overlooked for some time and was in need of a complete overhaul.</p>
<p><em>Here's a look at their old website's design, for reference:</em></p>
<a class="gallery" href="{{ site.url }}/img/works/chameleon/oldsite.jpg" title="The Old Website"><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/works/chameleon/oldsite.jpg" alt="Chameleon's Old Website" class="img850"></a>
<p>I began the redesign process with a complete content inventory and critical review. I took what content they had, and created a vision for the future of the website (and its purpose). With a go-ahead on my plans, I began creating a composition. I worked closely with department leaders and the president of the company to ensure their goals, as well as my own, were being met.</p>
<p>Once I had a solid basis of design guidelines set, and approval to move forward with the project., I began work on turning the composition into a reality. I used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> to create a mobile-friendly, responsive website that would look beautiful on all devices.</p>
<p>On desktops, smooth jQuery and CSS animations help realize a dynamic, engaging web experience. I chose to fade in many elements on the front page of the site in a staggered way, drawing inspiration from the company's namesake: the chameleon.</p>
<h4>Content-First Design:</h4>
<p>I gave content top priority for this design. I believe that content should dictate design, and not simply fill it.</p>
