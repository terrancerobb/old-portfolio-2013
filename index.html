			<h2><i class="icon-info-sign"></i>Who I Am</h2>
			<p>I grew up in a small town on a dead end road. I have been playing with design since my parents brought home our first computer when I was 11. Since then I've clocked many hours in front of a computer screen, tinkering and creating.</p>
			<p>I’ve always tried to foster my creative side&mdash;over the years delving into music, writing, film-making and graphics. To give some perspective, my very first website was a page filled with pictures of my favorite Pok&eacute;mon.</p>
			<p>Since then, I have worked hard on finding ways to create a great balance between creativity and technique, so that I might inspire passion and creativity in others with my work.</p>

				<h3><i class="icon-desktop"></i>Web & Graphic Design</h3>
				<p>Whether it’s websites, flyers, advertisements, banners or logos, I will design it - and I will thoroughly enjoy myself doing so!</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><i class="icon-equalizer"></i>Sound & Music Production</h3>
				<p>There are few things I enjoy more than being completely buried in an audio project. Songwriting, production, & foley are among the list of my favorite things to work on.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3><i class="icon-film"></i>Video Shooting & Editing</h3>
				<p>I feel very in my element when shooting, directing, and editing video projects. Part of this is due to video work sharing my strengths in having an eye for design and an ear for great sound.</p>
