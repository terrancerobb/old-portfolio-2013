				<h2>Who I Am</h2>
				<p>I grew up in southeast Michigan. I have been playing with design since I was very young. My parents brought home our first computer when I was 11, and it’s since been a strong interest of mine.</p>
				<p>I’ve always been the creative type--trying my hand over the years at music, writing, filmmaking and graphics. To give some perspective, my very first website was a page filled with pictures of my favorite pokémon.</p>
				<p>Since then, I have worked hard on finding ways to create a great balance between creativity and technique, so that I might inspire passion and creativity in others with my work.</p>
