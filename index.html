			<h2><i class="icon-info-sign"></i>Who I Am</h2>
			<p>I grew up in a small town in Michigan, and I have been playing with design since I was very young. My parents brought home our first computer when I was 11, and since then I've clocked many hours in front of a computer screen.</p>
			<p>I’ve always tried to foster my creative side--trying my hand over the years at music, writing, filmmaking and graphics. To give some perspective, my very first website was a page filled with pictures of my favorite pokémon.</p>
			<p>Since then, I have worked hard on finding ways to create a great balance between creativity and technique, so that I might inspire passion and creativity in others with my work.</p>

			<h3><i class="icon-desktop"></i>Web & Graphic Design</h3>
			<p>Whether it’s websites, flyers, advertisements, banners or logos, I will design it... and I will thoroughly enjoy myself doing so.</p>

			<h3><i class="icon-equalizer"></i>Sound & Music Production</h3>
			<p>There are few things I enjoy more than being elbow-deep in an audio project. Songwriting, production, & foley are among the list of my favorite things to work on.</p>

			<h3><i class="icon-film"></i>Video Shooting & Editing</h3>
			<p>I feel very in my element when shooting, directing, and editing video projects. Part of this is due to video work utilizing elements of graphic and sound design during production.</p>
